# AirBnB_clone
The console based app for handling data storage of the Airbnb clone

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the backend of the AirBnB clone project, with the console interface and also utilizing the `cmd` module  in Pytho.

### Command Interpreter Description
The command line interpreter mimics the Bash Shell but is tailored for specific commands relevant to the AirBnB website. Serving as the frontend of the web app, users can interact with the backend developed using Python OOP programming.

### Available Commands

- `quit` or `EOF`: Exits the program.
- `help`: Provides information on how to use a command.
- `create`: Creates a new instance of a valid class and saves it to the JSON file.
- `show`: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and ID.
- `destroy`: Deletes an instance based on the class name and ID.
- `all`: Prints all string representations of instances based on the class name.
- `update`: Updates an instance based on the class name and ID by adding or updating attributes.
- `count`: Retrieves the number of instances of a class.

The command line interpreter, coupled with the backend and file storage system, supports various actions, including creating new objects, retrieving objects, performing operations, updating attributes, and destroying objects.
